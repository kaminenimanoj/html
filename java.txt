language fundamentals:-
1 indentifiers
2 reserved words
3 date types
4 literals
5 arrays
6 types of varialler
7 var-arg methods
8 main methods
9 command line arguments
10 java coding stand

1 Identifiers:-
 a name in java program id indentifier

rolls for defining java identifier:-
the allowed chars in java chars-a to z,A to Z,0 to 9,$ and _ identifiers
if we are using any other char we will get compost time error

ex:-total_number is correct
total# is incorrect
total123 is correct
123total is incorrect
identifers are cannot start digit total123 vaild but 123 total invaild

ex-class test
{
int number=10;
int number=20;
int number=30;
}

in java indentifers who many char allowed
they is no length limit for java indentifer but is not requeted to take to length indentifiers
ex-int x=10; is correct
in if = 20;is incorrect why means we cannot use reserved words as indentifiers

ex:-class test
{
public static void main (string()args)
{
int runnable
system.out.printin(runable);
}
}

which of the are vaild java indentifiers
total_number is correct
total# is incorrect
123 total is incorrect
total123 is correct
ca$h is correct
_$_$_$_$_$_$_ is correct
all@hands is incorrect
java2share is correct
Integer is correct 
Int is correct 
int is in correct
