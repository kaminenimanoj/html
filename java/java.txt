4 literals
5 arrays
6 types of varialler
7 var-arg methods
8 main methods
9 command line arguments
10 java coding stand

1 Identifiers:-
 A name in java program identifier

rules for defining java identifier:-
"The allowed characters in Java identifiers are letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), the dollar sign ($), and the underscore (_); using any other character will result in a compile-time error."
ex:-total_number is correct
total# is incorrect
total123 is correct
123total is incorrect
Identifiers should not start with digits([0-9]). For example, "123manoj" is not a valid Java identifier. 

ex-class test
{
int number=10;
int number=20;
int number=30;
}

java identifers how many character allowed
An identifier in Java is the name given to Variables, Classes, Methods, Packages, Interfaces, etc. These are the unique names used to identify programming elements. Every Java Variable must be identified with a unique name.
ex-int x=10; is correct
in if = 20;is incorrect why means we cannot use reserved words as identifiers

ex:-class test
{
public static void main (string()args)
{
int runnable
system.out.printin(runable);
}
}

which of these are vaild java identifiers
total_number is correct
total# is incorrect
123 total is incorrect
total123 is correct
ca$h is correct
_$_$_$_$_$_$_ is correct
all@hands is incorrect
java2share is correct
Integer is correct 
Int is correct 
int is in correct

date types:-
In Java, every variable and every expression has a specific data type, and this type is determined at compile time.
Pure Object Oriented Language or Complete Object Oriented Language are Fully Object Oriented Language that supports or have features that treats everything inside the program as objects. 
It doesn't support primitive datatype(like int, char, float, bool, etc.).
There are seven qualities to be satisfied for a programming language to be pure object-oriented. They are:

primitive datatypes(8):-
1 numeric data types
2 non-numeric data types

1 numeric data types:-
1 integral data types
2 floating-point data types

1 integral data types
byte
short
int
long

2 floating-point data types
float
double

2 non-numeric data types
char
boolean

byte data type:-
size 1byte(8bits)

max valve:-127
min value:-128
range:- -128 to 127

Ex:-
byte b=10; is correct
byte b=127;is correct
byte b=128;is incorrect 
found=int
required=byte

byte b=true;
found=boolean

short=
size=2bytes(16 bits)
range=-2 power 15 to 2 power 15-1
[-32768 to 32767]

int=
the most commond used data type is int
size=4 bytes (32 bits)
range=-2 power 31 to 2 power 31-1
[-2147483648 to 2147483647]

Ex=int x=2147483647; is correct
int x=2147483648;is incorrect
ce-integer number to large

int x=2147483648l;
found=long
required=int

intx=true;
found=boolean 
required=int

floating-point data types

float:-
single precision-less ass
size=4 bytes
range=-3.4e08 to 3.4e08

double:-
double precision-more ass
size=8 bytes
range=-1.7e38 to 1.7e38

Boolean:-
Boolean b=true;
boolean b=0;
found=it
required=boolean
boolen b=true;

literals:-
int x=10;
int=datatype/keyword
x=variable/identifier
10=constant/literal

literal a constant valve which can be asscend is called literal meaning

ex=int x=10
x is name of variable or identifier
10 is a constant valve or literal

1 decimal literals:-(base-10)
int x=10;

2 octal form :-(base-8)
int x=010;

3 hexa decimal form:-(base-16)
int x=0x10;

these are only posiable way to find literal value for integer data types in java?

int x=10;is correct
int x=0786;is incorrect
ce-int x=0777;is correct
int x=oxface;is correct
int x=oxbeef;is correct
int x=oxBeer;is incorect

Arrays:-
1 introduction
2 array declaration
3 array creation
4 array initialization
5 array declaration,creation,and,initialization in a single line
6 length vs length()
7 anonymous arrays
8 array elament assignments
9 array variable assignments

1 introduction:-
Arrays in Java are fundamental data structures used to store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same data type.
They provide a way to organize and manage multiple values under a single variable name.
 
Key characteristics of Java arrays:

Homogeneous Elements:
All elements within an array must be of the same data type (e.g., all integers, all strings, all custom objects).

Fixed Size:
Once an array is created, its size (the number of elements it can hold) cannot be changed.

Indexed Access:
Each element in an array is identified by an index number, which represents its position.
Array indices in Java are zero-based, meaning the first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on. 

Objects in Java:
In Java, arrays are objects, meaning they are created using the new keyword and have properties like length (which returns the number of elements in the array).

array declaration:-
*one dimensional array declaration
int[] x;
int []x;
int x[];

ex:-int[6] x;
int[] x;
At the time of declaration we can't specify the size otherwise we get compile time error.

Two dimensional array declaration

ex:-int[][] x;
int [][]x;
int x[][];
int[] [];
int[] x[];
int []x[];

three dimensional array:-
int[x][] a;
int [][][]a;
int a[][][];
int [] [][]a;
int []a[][];
int [][]a[];
int [][] []a;
int [][] a[];
int []a[][];
int [][]a[];

Array creation:-
every array in java is an object only hence we create arrays by using new operator
ex:-int[] a=new int[3];
for every type corresponding classes are available and these classes are part of java language and not available to the programmer level

ex:- supin(a.getclass().gethome());[I
Arrat type | corresponding class name
           |
int[]      ->[I     
int[][]    ->[[I
double[]   ->[D
short[]    ->[s
byte[]     ->[B]
boolean[]  ->[Z

At the time of creation compulsory we should specify the size otherwise complie time error.

Ex:- int() x=new int[]; is invaild
int() x=new int[6]; is vaild
It is a legel to have an array with the size Zero in java.

ex:-int[]=new int[0];
To specify array size the allowed data types are bite,short,char,int it we are trying to specify any other type then we well get compile time  error.

two-dimensional creation:-
In java two-dimensional array not implemented by using matrix style people followed array of arrays approch for multi-dimensional array creation.
The main advantage of this approch memory vitilization will be improved.
ex:-int[][] x=new int[2][];
x[0]=new int[2]
x[1]=new int[3]
