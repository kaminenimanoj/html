language fundamentals:-
1 identifiers
2 reserved words
3 data types
4 literals
5 arrays
6 types of varialler
7 var-arg methods
8 main methods
9 command line arguments
10 java coding stand

1 Identifiers:-
 a name in java program identifier

rules for defining java identifier:-
"The allowed characters in Java identifiers are letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), the dollar sign ($), and the underscore (_); using any other character will result in a compile-time error."
ex:-total_number is correct
total# is incorrect
total123 is correct
123total is incorrect
Identifiers should not start with digits([0-9]). For example, "123geeks" is not a valid Java identifier. 

ex-class test
{
int number=10;
int number=20;
int number=30;
}

java identifers how many character allowed
An identifier in Java is the name given to Variables, Classes, Methods, Packages, Interfaces, etc. These are the unique names used to identify programming elements. Every Java Variable must be identified with a unique name.
ex-int x=10; is correct
in if = 20;is incorrect why means we cannot use reserved words as identifiers

ex:-class test
{
public static void main (string()args)
{
int runnable
system.out.printin(runable);
}
}

which of these are vaild java identifiers
total_number is correct
total# is incorrect
123 total is incorrect
total123 is correct
ca$h is correct
_$_$_$_$_$_$_ is correct
all@hands is incorrect
java2share is correct
Integer is correct 
Int is correct 
int is in correct

Reserved words:-
the total reserved words are 53
keywords(50),reserved(3)

keywords are 2 types
use keywords,unused keywords
in use keywords:-if..else...
unused keywords:- goto,const
23:54 14-08-2025
reserved keywords sholdnot be used
identifier shouldnot start with number
it shouldnot strat with uppercase latters

used keywords:-

reserved keyword
enum(1.5v)

date types:-
in java every variable and every expertion as same type .every assiament should be creaked by complier for type comparability
Pure Object Oriented Language or Complete Object Oriented Language are Fully Object Oriented Language that supports or have features that treats everything inside the program as objects. 
It doesn't support primitive datatype(like int, char, float, bool, etc.).
There are seven qualities to be satisfied for a programming language to be pure object-oriented. They are:

primitive date types(8):-
1 numeric date types
2 non-numeric data types

1 numeric date types:-
1 integral date types
2 floating-point date types

1 integral date types
byte
short
int
long

2 floating-point date types
float
double

2 non-numeric date types
char
boolean

byte date type:-
size 1byte(8bits)

max valve:-127
min value:-128
range:- -128 to 127

Ex:-
byte b=10; is correct
byte b=127;is correct
byte b=128;is incorrect 
ce:-possible loss of precision
found=int
required=byte

byte b=true;-ce:-incompotite types
found=boolean

short=
size=2bytes(16 bits)
range=-2 power 15 to 2 power 15-1
[-32768 to 32767]

int=
the most commond used date type is int
size=4 bytes (32 bits)
range=-2 power 31 to 2 power 31-1
[-2147483648 to 2147483647]

Ex=int x=2147483647; is correct
int x=2147483648;is incorrect
ce-integer number to large

int x=2147483648l;
found=long
required=int

intx=true;
ce-incompotible types
found=boolean 
required=int

floating-point date types

float:-
single precision-less ass
size=4 bytes
range=-3.4e08 to 3.4e08

double:-
double precision-more ass
size=8 bytes
range=-1.7e38 to 1.7e38

Boolean:-
Boolean b=true;
boolean b=0;
ce-incompotible types
found=it
required=boolean
boolen b=true;

literals:-
int x=10;
int=datatype/keyword
x=variable/identifier
10=constant/literal

literal a constant valve which can be asscend is called literal 

ex=int x=10
x is name of variable or identifier
10 is a constant valve or literal

1 decimal literals:-(base-10)
int x=10;

2 octal form :-(base-8)
int x=0x10;

3 hexa decimal form:-(base-16)
int x=0x10;

these are only posiable way to find literal value for integer data types

int x=10;is correct
int x=0786;is incorrect
ce-int x=0777;is correct
int x=oxface;is correct
int x=oxbeef;is correct
int x=oxBeer;is incorect
